## Perceptron Learning Algorithm 

As we know PLA fails when the data is not seperable. This question is taken from the book "Learning from Data" authored by Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa and others, chapter three.

I observed that the perceptron learning algorthim didn't converge. This outcome is aligned with the 
fact that the data is not linearly separable. With pocket-learning-algorithm the execution time was 0.246 and classification error 0.092.With linear regression the execution time was 0.00039 and classification error 0.103. Overall
      linear regression took less time to converge and both the algorithm were pretty close
      with the classification error.
